# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Brian Hasenstab
Besides coding, I love being outside, either running, hiking, sight-seeing or playing basketball. You can find me on Twitter [@bhaze31](https://twitter.com/bhaze31) and online at www.hazeshideaway.com

I am currently into all things Swift, building cross platform applications with SwiftUI, and building out tutorials so that I can learn using Python, JavaScript, Swift, and other languages.

Software is the past and future. Every company was small when it started. Build it and they will come. Having a starvation mindset does not help you. They may have built it, but you have not. Get it done.
